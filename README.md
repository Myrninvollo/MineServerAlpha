## MineServer Alpha
This is a project I've been working on for the last month , which is supposed to be an alternative to the Bukkit platform , 
which was taken down.
The download can be found at: http://www.mediafire.com/download/92v8h8kdamb0m19/MineServer_1.8.jar

#Installation
The server is like a normal server but you need to make 3 folders in the containing folder of the jar:
1.plugins : for plugins
2.data : for NBT data
3.perms : for commands permissions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#The Permissions File
[NAME]

[UNLOCALISED_NAME]

players:

[PLAYER1]

[PLAYER2]

commands:

[COMMAND1]

[COMMAND2]

[COLOR]

the file name should be "NAME.mpc".
NAME stands for fileName
UNLOCALISED_NAME stands for code name
COMMAND can be 
  
  1.A command name , For Example: "tp" (Enables TP)
  
  2.A disabled command , For Example : "-tp" (Disables TP)
  
  3.A statement (currently only "perms.all" which enables all commands except for disabled ones).

COLOR stands for color , which can be used for chat.
